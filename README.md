A character creator/planner for Fallout New Vegas.

This app will allow you to plan out your perfect build. Check off the perks that you want to use, and you will be able to see what S.P.E.C.I.A.L points you will need to spend in the begtinning of the game. There will also be an option included for those of you that want to account for Bobbleheads and other in game options that help increase SPECIAL points, if you don't mind waiting a bit longer in game for your character to come together.

Aditionally I will try to eventually provide support for the more popular perk mods and other mods that have to do with perks/special.


If you have other suggestions of how this planner can be improved, feel free to reach out!
